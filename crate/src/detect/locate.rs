//! Where a finding sits in the document's own vocabulary.
//!
//! A line and a column point at a place in a file. `metrics.headline.eyebrow`
//! points at a place in the *document*, and for the file this tool is
//! most often aimed at — a five-thousand-line locale catalogue — that is
//! the difference between a finding somebody can act on and a line
//! number they have to go and look up.
//!
//! Every format reader here answers one question: which byte ranges hold
//! a **value**, and what is the key path of each. Nothing here decides
//! what a finding is — `characters`, `normalize` and `scripts` do that,
//! identically for every format — so **a reader that is wrong about a
//! key path costs a key path and never a finding**. That inversion is
//! the whole design: an unparseable document still gets scanned, and
//! still reports everything in it.
//!
//! They are line scanners over the raw text rather than parsers over a
//! tree, which is also the only way the offsets stay the raw document's.
//! Offsets are what the entire report is indexed by, and a parser hands
//! back decoded values with its own.
//!
//! Each reader states its own limits in its own module. None of them
//! reconstructs a document.
